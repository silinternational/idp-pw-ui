        I forgot my password, how do I reset it?
    </h3>

    <p class="md-body-1">
        There are several ways to reset your password. The main method
        sends an email with a reset link to your primary email address.
        If you do not have access to your primary email account you may
        also choose to have the link sent to you supervisor or spouse. The
        third option requires setting up recovery methods in advance;
        these methods can include additional email accounts or phone
        numbers which you have. It is recommended that you add at least
        one additional recovery method to your account to help ensure you
        can reset your password in a time of need. You can reset your
        password by going to <a ng-href="#/forgot">Forgot password</a>,
        entering your username or email address and proceeding through the
        process.

        What is a recovery method?
    </h3>

    <p class="md-body-1">
        Recovery methods are ways for you to verify your identity so that
        you can set a new password for your account. You are encouraged to
        set up either email or phone based recovery methods. Then, in the
        event of forgetting your password, you can use one of these
        recovery methods for resetting your password. You may either have
        a link sent by email or a reset code delivered as a text message
        or voice call to your phone. You can manage your recovery methods
        by going to <a ng-href="#/profile">My profile</a>.

        Password tips
    </h3>

    <p class="md-body-1">
        Passwords are just like keys to your house and should be treated
        similarly. Below are some tips that will help you choose good
        passwords and keep your Insite account safe and secure.
    </p>

    <ul class="md-body-1">
        <li>
            Use a password manager. Password managers such as
            <a href="https://lastpass.com" target="_blank">LastPass</a>,
            <a href="http://keepass.info" target="_blank">KeePass</a>, and
            <a href="https://1password.com" target="_blank">1Password</a>
            all make it easy to generate highly complex passwords and save
            them for you so that you do not need to remember them all. A
            password manager makes it very easy to meet all the following
            recommendations.
        </li>
        <li>
            Use unique passwords. Do not use the same password for more
            than one site. In the same way you do not use the same key for
            your house, car, office, and safe deposit box, you do not want
            to use the same password for multiple sites.
        </li>
        <li>
            Use complex passwords that contain a mix of words, numbers,
            special characters, and both uppercase and lowercase letters.
            Do not make simple letter/number substitutions like a 3 for
            the letter E or ! for an I or L, these are common and easily
            cracked. Long random sentences like “Big smelly frog lives 12
            years!” are easy to remember and hard to crack.
        </li>
        <li>
            Don’t use family names or special dates like birthdays or
            anniversaries. This information is not always private and is
            so commonly used that hackers will use this information in
            their attempts to crack your password.
        </li>
        <li>
            Never share your password with anyone!
        </li>
    </ul>
